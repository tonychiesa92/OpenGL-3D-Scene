# OpenGL-3D-Scene

### How do I approach designing software?
- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This project helped me craft 2 new desgin skills, first, taking a visual object and attempting to implent code to reproduce it. The second skill I learned was taking existing code and learning to manipulate it so that it would fit my needs. I followed the classic Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC), by building the project in smaller sections it allowed me to meet smaller goals and easily combine the project together at the end. My design approach can easily be applied in future work. Making sections of my code modular and repeatable is a tatic that saves time on future projects.

### How do I approach developing programs?
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

By making my code reusable as a development strategy it allowed me to quickly make new objects in my 3D scene. Having multiple iterations of the project allowed me to update the project as I went throughout the milestones. Breaking up this large project into smaller more achivable goals throught the semester.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Going forward in my education and professional carrer, computational graphics and visualizations allows me to utalize my computer science skills to visualize the problem at hand that I am attempting to solve and apply best coding practices.
